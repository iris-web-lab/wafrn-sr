  <h1>Enable bluesky</h1>
  <p>Read this! There is some jank still!</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Only posts marked as <b>public</b> will go to bluesky</li>
    <li>
      Notifications on bluesky SOMETIMES can be janky. Not seeing a follower on wafrn doesnt mean the follower does not
      exist.
    </li>
    <li>By default, <b>all bluesky posts are public</b> wich means there is no unlisted post</li>
    <li><b>Bluesky automaticaly accepts all follows by default</b>. Its different from fedi</li>
    <li>
      Its owned by a corporation and they may not be your jam. We will do the best to protect you from possible stupid
      things they might do in the future
    </li>
    <li>
      Bluesky blocks are public by default. We are still not federating them, but we will add the option to make your
      blocks on bluesky public in the future
    </li>
    <li>
      Some posts may be marked as "only people i follow can reply" and stuff like that. Some jank we havent finished
    </li>
    <li>Like on fedi, not every post of every account gets saved in wafrn. We only save as much as we need</li>
    <li>There is jank</li>
    <li>There is jank and we are on it</li>
    <li>There is A LOT OF JANK and we are on it</li>
    <li>At the moment of writing this, your header image may not federate with bluesky still :(</li>
