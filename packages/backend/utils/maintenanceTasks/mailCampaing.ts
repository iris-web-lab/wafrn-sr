<p>We have made a <del>nothing at all</del> quite a few things to <a href="https://app.wafrn.net" target="_blank">wafrn</a>! Not only the bluesky thing, but some cool stuff!</p>
<p>Some friends have helped me and now we have a LIGHT THEME, a BASIC THEME SELECTOR, and a VERY IMPROVED UI. Again. We have changed it a bit. To better!</p>
<p>Regarding bluesky, you need to dm @gabboman so he can enable bluesky for your account, as some details are still <a href="https://app.wafrn.net/fediverse/post/5a058af2-fc8a-4d36-8edd-36faecafb250" target="_blank">a bit janky in some parts</a></p>
<p>But if you feel like you wanna see some cool artists, its totaly worth it! There is <a href="https://app.wafrn.net/fediverse/post/fe6ef464-4987-446b-bf42-9879eebcbe9f" target="_blank">raxdflipnote</a> and  <a href="https://app.wafrn.net/fediverse/post/ad855e93-1476-4b0f-9f75-38c10836cd04" target="_blank">gaz</a></p>
<p>And finaly, if you have one spare buck, give it to me! I want to invite my wife to a pizza. We have <a href="https://patreon.com/wafrn">patreon</a> and <a href="https://ko-fi.com/wafrn">ko-fi</a>. You dont have to, but it would be cool</p>
<h2>Come back to <a href="https://app.wafrn.net">wafrn</a>, we miss you!</h2>
<p>(Columbo voice): Oh, a just final thing, <a href="https://app.wafrn.net/fediverse/post/b574e933-0485-43ef-9a4e-c20f4d0a34ae">someone is working on an app</a></p>
